	<h3>Section 1</h3>
	<p>Here is what it is like there now; many people have phones, and some even have smartphones. Those that do have become quite adept and building websites, doing graphic design, and learning new skills to compete using the small devices. Computers are expensive in comparison to the living wage. We have made many connections with community centers in the refugee camps in Kenya, where there is very little opportunity to work to afford the exorbitant cost of data bundles for cell phone data. We can provide new hope and real economic options for them.</p>
